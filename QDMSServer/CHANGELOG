Version 0.8.2
- Added support for quarterly frequencies. FRED and Quandl can now download quarterly data. 
	IMPORTANT: if you currently have any data at annual frequencies, it will be re-labeled as quarterly. You will need to clear the data and download it again.
- Added an item in the instrument context menu allowing you to set a session template for multiple instruments.
- Various small bugfixes, mostly in the continuous futures broker.
