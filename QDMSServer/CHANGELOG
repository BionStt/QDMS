Version 0.8.3
- Changed ZeroMQ libraries from clrzmq to NetMQ, streamlining a lot of server code in the process.
- Fixed an issue with data storage when a bar opening time was null.
- Added a workaround for situations when data update jobs run simultaneously, in which case only one of them worked. Now they simply run one after the other.
- Fixed a bug that cause the SQL Server authentication choice to not be used.

Version 0.8.2
- Added support for quarterly frequencies. FRED and Quandl can now download quarterly data. 
	IMPORTANT: if you currently have any data at annual frequencies, it will be re-labeled as quarterly. You will need to clear the data and download it again.
- Added an item in the instrument context menu allowing you to set a session template for multiple instruments.
- Various small bugfixes, mostly in the continuous futures broker.
